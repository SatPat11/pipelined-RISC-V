Custom Instruction added to count the trailing zeros:

             CTZ operation (count trailing zeros)
            4'b0100: begin
                integer i, count;
                count = 0;
                for (i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
                        if (A[i] == 1'b0)
                            count = count + 1;
                        else
                            i=32;
                end
                ALUOut = count;
            end
Opcode - used same as the Immediate then for funct3 i have used 101
